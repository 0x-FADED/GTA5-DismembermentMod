- continuation of [dismemberment Mod](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/dismemberment) for GTA5 which doesn't work anymore.
# what I changed from originial version
- identified the issue with why this was not working and fixed the issue it needed some [memory patching](https://github.com/0x-FADED/GTA5-SpawningBlock-bypass/blob/main/GTA5-SpawningBlock-bypass/src/dllmain.cpp) but now it's included in [SHVDN](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet/commit/ee58753b1d2de382e2da804998312b070072dc08).
- re-wrote the c# script for performance optimizations and updated to SHVDN v3 API
